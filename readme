Shell scripts I use everyday, working with drupal.

All scripts here are fairly simple in function. They mostly wrap popular
drupal scripts/modules (like drush or features).


# @TODO ##############################################################

- make PROJECT_BASE more powerful by porting it to dynamic scripts that sit in
  this repository.
